# Hi, I'm Dev!

I'm a graphic design enthusiast, aspiring web designer, and recent graduate of SMU Code Bootcamp to develop skills utilizing the MERN stack and mySQL. Iâ€™ve always had a passion for graphic and web design since Tom was my first MySpace friend. Over the years, Iâ€™ve made a lot of show flyers, album covers, church bulletins, posters, tanning salon signs, and hand-drawn logos but web development is a rediscovery for me. Through the course of the bootcamp, my goal is to gain enough knowledge to be dangerous enough to build websites and applications that standout from the rest. Thanks for hanging out!

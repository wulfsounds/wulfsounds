# Hi, I'm Dev!

I'm a Dallas based UI designer and developer with over twenty years of combined graphic and web design. I am a contracted web designer for ![Headspace](https://img.shields.io/badge/Headspace-F47D31.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=Headspace&logoColor=white) to assist and collaborate with the web marketing team. In 12 months of my tenure, I supported the renovation of the companyâ€™s brand architecture for 2024. As an expert in CMS-based apps and graphic design, I create digital experiences that increase access to wellness for the global community.

Thanks for stopping by!
